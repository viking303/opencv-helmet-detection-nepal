# Helmet Detection for Road Safety in Nepal

This project uses OpenCV and YOLO to detect whether motorbike riders are wearing helmets, targeting road safety improvements in Kathmandu and other Nepali cities.

## Why it matters
- Nepal has high motorbike usage and frequent accidents.
- Helmet compliance is critical; automated detection supports awareness and enforcement.

## Tech stack
- OpenCV for image/video processing
- YOLOv5/YOLOv8 for object detection
- Python (Colab for training), optional Streamlit for demo

## Quick start
1. Open the Colab notebook (`notebooks/helmet_detection_nepal.ipynb`).
2. Run the cells to train or evaluate the model.
3. See `examples/` for demo outputs.

## Demo try:
https://helmet-detection-nepal.streamlit.app/


## Results
- Add precision/recall, confusion matrix, and demo screenshots.
- Note limitations and next steps (larger dataset, domain adaptation).

## Credits
- YOLO model authors and dataset sources listed in the notebook.
- Built for real-world impact in Nepal.
